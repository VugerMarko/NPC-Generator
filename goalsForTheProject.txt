Need to do:
    - Need to make a formula that decides npc level based on party CR in case they want to fight them
        - One thing that will make this difficult is that CR is determined on multiple factors such as overall party level,
          magical items, and campaign progression, which makes it difficult to decide if this feature is even worth implementing
    - Need to make a generation of the spell sheet based on spellcasting class and level 
    - Need to make an algorithm that decides by random the stats of the npc

Completed:
    - Implement OpenAI API
    - Print out a short description based on gender, race, and class
