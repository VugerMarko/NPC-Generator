Need to do:
    - Need to make a formula that decides npc level based on party CR in case they want to fight them
        - One thing that will make this difficult is that CR is determined on multiple factors such as overall party level,
          magical items, and campaign progression, which makes it difficult to decide if this feature is even worth implementing

    - Need to make ability score improvements feature
    - Need to make a feature where when the data is pulled from the database, the script chooses up to three skills to add a proficiency bonus in
    - Need to add a feature when the numbered rolls for the abilities are made, then the highest number is applied to the classes' ability

Completed:
    - Need to make a functional database from where I will call information about classes
    - Implement OpenAI API
    - Need to make a callable function that counts proficiency bonus, based on level and count that in the ability scores
