Need to do:
    - Need to make a formula that decides npc level based on party CR in case they want to fight them
        - One thing that will make this difficult is that CR is determined on multiple factors such as overall party level,
          magical items, and campaign progression, which makes it difficult to decide if this feature is even worth implementing

    - Need to make a feature where when the data is pulled from the database, the script chooses up to three skills to add a proficiency bonus in

Completed:
    - Need to make ability score improvements feature
