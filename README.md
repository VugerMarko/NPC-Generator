# NPC-Generator
DnD NPC generator for easing the Dungeon Master's work load.

You can use this while you're DMing to your party and party member decides to talk to the NPC they just saw and you have problems with improvising?

With just one click generate an npc with whole character sheet at ready!
With included, name, race, class, level, hit points and description of the character, it eases your job as a DM and reduces the workload
when doing improvisation while roleplaying.

# How to use it?

### For Windows
1. Download the whole folder and put it on the desktop
2. Go to Command Prompt and `cd` to the folder
3. Then type `python main.py`
4. Enjoy the random generation!

### For Linux
1. Downlaod the whole folder and put it on the desktop
2. Make sure the first line of your file has `#!/usr/bin/env python`
3. Use in the terminal `cd` command to get to the folder
4. Make it executable `chmod +x main.py`
5. And run it as `./main.py`
6. Enjoy the random generation!

### One key note to add:
You will need to use your own OpenAI API key for this, I am still unknowledgable on how to make this part of the process user-friendly, so keep that in mind.

There will still be updates in the future, so no need to worry!
